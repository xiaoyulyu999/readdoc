Project Overview
----------------

The current project utilizes a Django backend with a decision-tree model from scikit-learn. However, the goal is to upgrade to a more advanced AI model, similar to GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer). The primary challenge lies in incorporating humanity fairness into the scheduling process.

Humanity Fairness Challenge
---------------------------

The AI model must balance efficiency with empathy. For instance:
Scheduling good employees might be straightforward, but what about those who are not as efficient? Perhaps they have family obligations or personal difficulties that impact their work.
Can the model accommodate these factors and schedule with kindness, rather than a cold, calculating approach?

Desired Model Behavior
----------------------

The ideal AI model should:

Prioritize efficiency: Optimize schedules for maximum productivity.
Consider employee well-being: Take into account individual circumstances, such as family responsibilities or personal challenges.
Demonstrate empathy: Schedule with kindness, rather than solely focusing on performance metrics.

Next Steps

To achieve this, we can explore the following options:
Integrate a more advanced AI model: Utilize a GPT-like model that can learn from data and adapt to complex scenarios.
Incorporate fairness metrics: Develop metrics that measure the model's fairness and empathy in scheduling decisions.
Collect and analyze data: Gather data on employee circumstances and performance to train the model and improve its decision-making.
By addressing these challenges and incorporating a more advanced AI model, we can create a scheduling system that balances efficiency with humanity fairness.
