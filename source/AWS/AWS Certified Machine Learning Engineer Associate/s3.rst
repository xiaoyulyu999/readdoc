.. admonition:: What is Amazon S3?

   - **Definition**:

     - Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is AWS's scalable, durable object storage service.
     - Used as a foundational building block for many AWS services and architectures.


   - **Key Concepts**:

     - Infinitely scalable storage with 99.999999999% (11 9's) durability.
     - Object-based storage: Stores data as *objects* within *buckets*.
     - Globally unique bucket names.
     - Region-specific bucket deployment.


.. admonition:: ‚úÖ Use Cases for Amazon S3

   - Backup and storage (files, disks, etc.)
   - Disaster recovery (cross-region replication)
   - Archival (e.g. S3 Glacier, cheaper long-term storage)
   - Hybrid cloud storage (on-premise + cloud)
   - Media hosting (video, images)
   - Hosting static websites
   - Delivering software updates
   - Data lakes and big data analytics


   **Real-World Examples**:

   - Nasdaq uses S3 Glacier to archive 7 years of data.
   - Sysco runs analytics to gain business insights via Amazon S3.

.. admonition:: Buckets & Objects

   - **Bucket**:

     - Top-level container in S3.
     - Created within a specific region.
     - Must have a globally unique name.

   - **Naming Requirements**:

     - No uppercase letters or underscores.
     - Length: 3 to 63 characters.
     - Must not resemble an IP address.
     - Begin with a lowercase letter or number.
     - Not start with prefix "xn- -", or end with suffix "-s3alia"

   - **Objects**:

     - Stored within buckets.
     - Each object has a *key* (full path name).
     - Keys can simulate folders using "/" separators.
     - Maximum object size: **5TB**.
     - Objects > 5GB require **multi-part upload**.

.. admonition:: Object Structure

   - **Key**:

     - Unique identifier for each object in the bucket.
     - Example: s3://my-bucket/my-folder/another-folder/myfile.txt
               kye is 'my-folder/another-folder/myfile.txt'. Prefix: my_folder/another_folder/, Object name: my_file.txt

   - **Value**:

     - Actual content (binary or text).
     - 5TB max.
     - Multi-part Upload: > 5TB max.



   - **Metadata**:

     - System-defined and user-defined key-value pairs.
     - Used to describe properties of the object.


   - **Tags**:

     - Up to 10 Unicode key-value pairs.
     - Useful for lifecycle rules, access policies, and tracking.


   - **Version ID**:

     - Assigned when versioning is enabled on the bucket.

.. admonition:: ‚úÖ Storage & Upload Notes

   - Multi-part Upload:

     - Required for uploading large files efficiently.
     - Especially for files > 5GB.


   - Versioning:

     - Enables multiple versions of the same object.
     - Useful for recovery and rollback.

.. admonition:: üîç Summary

   - Amazon S3 is foundational to many AWS architectures.
   - Offers scalable, durable, and flexible storage.
   - Suitable for backup, archival, analytics, web hosting, and more.
   - Buckets and objects are core concepts to understand.
   - Follow naming rules and regional deployment considerations.

.. admonition:: üîó To Learn More

   - Hands-on with the AWS Console to create buckets, upload objects, enable versioning.
   - Explore S3 lifecycle rules, S3 Glacier, and cross-region replication.
   - Try integrating S3 with other services (e.g., Lambda, Athena, Redshift).

.. admonition::  Security

   - User-Based:
      IAM Policies - which API calls should be allowed for a specific user from IAM.
   - Resource-Based:
      Bucket Policies - bucket wide rules from the S3 console - allows across account.
      Object Access Control List (ACL) - finer grain (can be disabled)
      Bucket Access Control List (ACL) - less common (can be disabled)

.. admonition::  S3 Bucket Policies

   - JSON based
   - Resources: buckets and objects
   - Effect: Allow/Deny
   - Actions: Set of API to Allow or Deny
   - Principal: The account or user to apply the policy to
   - If your bucket should never be public, leave the Block Public Access on.

.. admonition::  S3 Version

   - Know the difference between on and off "Show versions".
   - Off: To delete an object with a specific version, enable 'Show versions' to view versioned keys. You can reverse a deletion by removing the delete marker (version key).
   - On: Delete permenently.

.. admonition:: Amazon S3 Replication

   - **Two types:**

     - **CRR (Cross-Region Replication)**: Replicates objects to a bucket in a *different* region
     - **SRR (Same-Region Replication)**: Replicates objects to a bucket in the *same* region

   - **Requirements:**

     - Versioning must be enabled on both source and destination buckets
     - Proper IAM permissions are required for S3 to perform replication
     - Buckets can be in different AWS accounts
     - Replication is asynchronous (runs in the background)

   - **CRR Use Cases:**

      - Compliance and disaster recovery
      - Lower latency data access in another region
      - Cross-account replication

   - **SRR Use Cases:**

     - Log aggregation across multiple buckets
     - Live replication between production and test environments

   - **Only new objects** are replicated after enabling replication.
   - To replicate **existing objects** and previously **failed replications**, use **S3 Batch Replication**.
   - **Delete markers** can optionally be replicated from source to destination.

     - **Permanent deletions with version ID** are *not* replicated to avoid propagating malicious deletes.

   - **Replication chaining is not supported**:

     - If Bucket A replicates to Bucket B, and Bucket B replicates to Bucket C, objects from A will *not* reach C.

.. image:: images/table-1.png

.. admonition:: Use Cases

   **S3 Standard (General Purpose):**
      - Big data analytics - For frequently accessed datasets requiring high throughput
      - Mobile and gaming applications - Low latency access for app data and user content
      - Content distribution - Serving websites, media files, and frequently downloaded content
      - Primary storage - Default choice for active workloads and frequently accessed data

   **S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (Standard-IA)**

      - Disaster recovery - Backup data that needs rapid access during emergencies
      - Long-term backups - Data accessed less frequently but requiring quick retrieval when needed
      - File synchronization - Secondary copies of important files
      - Data archiving - Medium-term storage where occasional access is required

   **S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (One Zone-IA)**

      - Secondary backup copies - Non-critical backups where you can tolerate AZ loss
      - On-premises data replicas - Storing copies of data that exists elsewhere
      - Recreatable data - Data that can be regenerated if lost (processed datasets, thumbnails)
      - Cost-sensitive archiving - When you need lower costs and can accept higher risk

   **Glacier Instant Retrieval**

      - Medical imaging archives - Patient records accessed quarterly for compliance
      - Financial records - Regulatory data requiring instant access but infrequent use
      - Legal documents - Case files that may need immediate retrieval
      - Quarterly reporting data - Business intelligence data accessed once per quarter

   **Glacier Flexible Retrieval**

      - Media archives - Video/audio content for production companies
      - Scientific data - Research datasets for periodic analysis
      - Compliance archives - Regulatory data with flexible retrieval requirements
      - Backup restoration - System backups where you can wait hours for recovery

   **Glacier Deep Archive**

      - Long-term compliance - 7-10 year regulatory retention requirements
      - Digital preservation - Libraries, museums, historical records
      - Tape replacement - Migrating from physical tape storage systems
      - Rarely accessed archives - Data kept for legal/compliance but almost never accessed

   **S3 Intelligent-Tiering**

      - Unknown access patterns - New applications where usage isn't predictable
      - Changing workloads - Data that transitions between frequent and infrequent access
      - Cost optimization - Automatic savings without operational overhead
      - Mixed datasets - Large datasets with varying access frequencies
      - Set-and-forget archiving - When you want automatic optimization without manual management

   Key Decision Factors:
      - Choose based on:
         - Access frequency - How often you need the data
         - Retrieval time tolerance - How quickly you need access (milliseconds to days)
         - Cost sensitivity - Balance between storage cost and retrieval cost
         - Durability requirements - Whether you can tolerate AZ-level failures
         - Operational overhead - Whether you want manual control or automatic optimization

   Common Migration Patterns:
      - Active data ‚Üí S3 Standard
      - Aging data ‚Üí Standard-IA (after 30 days)
      - Archive data ‚Üí Glacier classes (after 90+ days)
      - Long-term retention ‚Üí Deep Archive (after 180+ days)
