Introduction to Machine Learning with C++
=========================================

In general, ML approaches have the idea of searching patterns in a given dataset as their basis. Consider a recommendation system for a news feed, which provides the user with a personalized feed based on their previous activity or preferences. The software gathers information about the type of news article the user reads and calculates some statistics. For example, it could be the frequency of some topics appearing in a set of news articles. Then, it performs some predictive analytics, identifies general patterns, and uses them to populate the user’s news feed. Such systems periodically track a user’s activity, update the dataset, and calculate new trends for recommendations.
